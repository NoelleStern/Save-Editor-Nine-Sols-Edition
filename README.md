## Technical info⚙️

It turned out to be quite a technical challenge to make it all work. The biggest problem was to pack the data back in a way the game can still read it. The game is data marker sensitive and so the usual MessagePack encoding library just wouldn't cut it. MessagePack libraries mostly aim to provide a smaller file size rather than accuracy. I made [rmpp rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/rmpp) and [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rmpp) specifically to solve this issue.

### How's the data encoded🔣

The save data is stored in a deflated MessagePack-encoded binary file of `.sav`/`.sav.bak` extension. The latter simply being a backup. So the general editing process looks something like: `inflate → decode → edit → encode → deflate`.
